<h3>Author: Eklavya Mishra</h3>



<h3>Objective:</h3>

<ul>

    <li>To create animated circular fractals for awesome visual patterns.</li>

</ul>

<br /><br />

<h3>Controls:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Space -> Generate New Pattern</li>

</ul>
<br /><br />


<h3>Logic Design and Implementation:</h3>

<ul>
<li>An object pool of bubbles is created on start. On a set interval a bubble is chosen, given a random size and velocity and spawned.</li>

<li>Each bubble handles its own movement logic and death animation on getting hit by a bullet.</li>

<li>They can also be in one of two states which are either to move towards the player or away from them.</li>

<li>For spawning, one of the 4 sides of the game is chosen. Just beyond it the bubble is spawned which then proceeds to chase the player.</li>

<li>For creating the player a simple tank like turret is created which can be rotated and moved using player input.</li>

<li>An object pool of bullets is created for the player for powerup effect to take place. Though most of the time the player is only able to shoot one.</li>

<li>On shooting the bullet travels from turret head in the direction it is rotated.</li>

<li>After moving beyond the screen or colliding with another bubble the bullet is returned to the pool.</li>

<li>For the powerup only one object is created as only one can exist at a time.</li>

<li>On colliding with the powerup by either shooting at it or touching it, the states of all existing enemies start to move away and a temporary power is given unto the player.</li>

<li>The time for which the powerup will exist is shown as an arc around the powerup.</li>

<li>If the player collides with an enemy it expands till it covers the screen and the end screen is shown.</li>

<li>Just to show progress the high score is also updated if the player is able to beat its own score.</li>

</ul>

<br /><br />

<!-- <h3>Scope For Improvement:</h3>

<ul><li>Implement Audio to the game.</ul>

<ul><li>Adding more types of powers and more number of states for the enemies to be in.</ul> -->
